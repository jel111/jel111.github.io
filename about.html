						<h3>About Neighbosit</h3>
						<p>If you wondering who we are you have landed on the right page.</p>
						<p>We are neighbors just like you who are living in a community where we would like to see people get to know each other
							a little better. We generally feel that most people are the exact saem as us and would like to get that sense of community
							back where they live. We have lived in a few different neighborhoods these past few ears and wish that an App such
							as Neighborsit existed to make our transition as new neighbors much smoother.</p>
						<p>We started Neighborsit out of necessity. One crazy day, you know the ones where things just keep coming with the relentlessness
							of a hungry lion, and we needed someone to sit our youngest who is 2 for just an hour at the very last minute. We
							tried all tge usual suspects but no one we knew was a vialable at the last minute. We were stuck and had to take him
							with even though we could it would have made things much simpler if we hadn't. "LightBulb!" I am hearing Steve Correl
							from Minions reciting that line. I wish there was an app for that! Your first thought maybe well there is and that
							is Facebook. Well it actually isn't because we only have the opportunnity to contact people we know and not people
							catorgorized by neighbor hood. Our neighborhood. </p>
						<p>We know a lot of the neighbors but would we ask them to sit our child? Would we know enough about them to allow them
							to sit our children? Thi sis the great part of Neighborsit, we don't have too! If we know Sara really well and she
							knows John and can vouch for him then we would feel much more comfortable. His light is on an availablke so we just
							contact hom and he says sure briung him on over and next weekend when he has an issue and we are available we most
							certainly will help him. New neighbor on the christmas card list!</p>
