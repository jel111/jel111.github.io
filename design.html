							<h3>Neighborsit Design</h3>
							<p>On this page we are going to show the life cycle of our design. We are hoping to get help from the community with
								that process. I think this will greatly improve not only the look and feel of the App but the whole functionality.
								This app will not only be a community driven but community designed application and website.</p>
							<p>In the near future we are going to be running contests to see who can come up with the best designed button or the
								best designed logo. Maybe we will even go as far as the best designed page!</p>
							<p>We will hopefully get that far. As we stand right now the feedback that we desparately need is about how this app
								is seen to other people. What I mean by this is when you heard the name, NeighborSit, and then got a glimpse at what
								it is supposed to do what were your first thoughts. I would love it if you could leave those thoughts in the form
								below.
							</p>
							<h3>Why are we asking the community?</h3>
							<p>Neighbor sit is a community driven app. Without a community behind this app it goes absolutely nowhere. So why not
								have our neighbors help us design this app? We are the ones that will use it and we are the ones that know what we
								want out of this app. Sure our team knows what we think this app should do but we are really interested in what our
								neighbors think.</p>
							<p>I don't know if you have noticed but my favorite websites and apps as of late have been asking there community or
								"Neighbors" what they think. What they would do to the app or website to make it better in their eyes. As the old
								saying goes two Neighbors are better than one! Ok so I took a little liberty with that sayong but you get the point.
								I will say again that we need our neighbors input in this matter. Sometimes you can get so close to something that
								you just need a new set of eyes on it. They will most times make you aware of that elephant in the room. We may have
								forgotten something so simple, so glaringly obvious that everybody thinks why didn't they do such and such? Us being
								so close to this day after day makes us oblivious to the simple stuff. Any and all suggetions are very much appreciated.
								Please, just be kind and respectful because we have feelings and are not just a screen on a desk with no emotions
								and a computer voice. </p>
							<h4>Thank you very much for taking time out of your busy day to give us a hand!</h4>
							<p>Please don't forget about the form at the bottom of this page. You can just say hi and we will sign you up to receive
								updates on how things are going and of our release date. We will not give anyone your email address or information
								and if you state you do not want to receive updates just a release notification we will honor that too. The updates
								will be no more than one a week unless we have big news like, contest winners or something along those lines. Thanks
								again for being a great <strong>neighbor</strong> and have an awesome day!</p>
